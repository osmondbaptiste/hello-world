Introductory repository
Hi there. I am a new comer to GitHub. I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and an associate's degree in Information Technology. I have some programming experience in C/C++ and I have a solid understanding of object oriented design principles. I also know a bit of Java and i'm looking to learn Python, web designing and assemble language programming. I was told that Github is the place to get some good program design and coding experience, so here I am.
